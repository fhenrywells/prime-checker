“While the three in the pinnace debated what to do, the Ring sent a second bitmap to the pinnace: 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 9. Then a third bitmap: 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 16, 6, 10, 10, 4, 7. A fourth: 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 19, 5, 1, 15, 4, 8. A fifth: 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 7, 2, 16, 4, 1, 14. The bitmaps came one after another. The first six numbers in each consisted of the six prime numbers sent by the pinnace as a greeting.”
― Liu Cixin, Death's End

I find prime numbers, and the concept of prime factorization as a way of discovering them, to be a very fun concept that can teach folks fun tricks in math. After trying to verify whether a few 4 digit numbers were prime using these tricks, with mental math errors causing me to mess this up, I thought it could be fun to have a conversation with Claude about these tricks and use them to build a visualization tool allowing anyone to easily discover and learn about prime numbers.
